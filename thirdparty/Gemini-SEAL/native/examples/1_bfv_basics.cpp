    /*
    In this example, we demonstrate performing simple computations (a polynomial
    evaluation) on encrypted integers using the BFV encryption scheme.

    The first task is to set up an instance of the EncryptionParameters class.
    It is critical to understand how the different parameters behave, how they
    affect the encryption scheme, performance, and the security level. There are
    three encryption parameters that are necessary to set:

        - poly_modulus_degree (degree of polynomial modulus);
        - coeff_modulus ([ciphertext] coefficient modulus);
        - plain_modulus (plaintext modulus; only for the BFV scheme).

    The BFV scheme cannot perform arbitrary computations on encrypted data.
    Instead, each ciphertext has a specific quantity called the `invariant noise
    budget' -- or `noise budget' for short -- measured in bits. The noise budget
    in a freshly encrypted ciphertext (initial noise budget) is determined by
    the encryption parameters. Homomorphic operations consume the noise budget
    at a rate also determined by the encryption parameters. In BFV the two basic
    operations allowed on encrypted data are additions and multiplications, of
    which additions can generally be thought of as being nearly free in terms of
    noise budget consumption compared to multiplications. Since noise budget
    consumption compounds in sequential multiplications, the most significant
    factor in choosing appropriate encryption parameters is the multiplicative
    depth of the arithmetic circuit that the user wants to evaluate on encrypted
    data. Once the noise budget of a ciphertext reaches zero it becomes too
    corrupted to be decrypted. Thus, it is essential to choose the parameters to
    be large enough to support the desired computation; otherwise the result is
    impossible to make sense of even with the secret key.
    */
    EncryptionParameters parms(scheme_type::BFV);

    /*
    The first parameter we set is the degree of the `polynomial modulus'. This
    must be a positive power of 2, representing the degree of a power-of-two
    cyclotomic polynomial; it is not necessary to understand what this means.

    Larger poly_modulus_degree makes ciphertext sizes larger and all operations
    slower, but enables more complicated encrypted computations. Recommended
    values are 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, but it is also possible
    to go beyond this range.

    In this example we use a relatively small polynomial modulus. Anything
    smaller than this will enable only very restricted encrypted computations.
    */
    size_t poly_modulus_degree = 4096;
    parms.set_poly_modulus_degree(poly_modulus_degree);

    /*
    Next we set the [ciphertext] `coefficient modulus' (coeff_modulus). This
    parameter is a large integer, which is a product of distinct prime numbers,
    each up to 60 bits in size. It is represented as a vector of these prime
    numbers, each represented by an instance of the Modulus class. The
    bit-length of coeff_modulus means the sum of the bit-lengths of its prime
    factors.

    A larger coeff_modulus implies a larger noise budget, hence more encrypted
    computation capabilities. However, an upper bound for the total bit-length
    of the coeff_modulus is determined by the poly_modulus_degree, as follows:

        +----------------------------------------------------+
        | poly_modulus_degree | max coeff_modulus bit-length |
        +---------------------+------------------------------+
        | 1024                | 27                           |
        | 2048                | 54                           |
        | 4096                | 109                          |
        | 8192                | 218                          |
        | 16384               | 438                          |
        | 32768               | 881                          |
        +---------------------+------------------------------+

    These numbers can also be found in native/src/seal/util/hestdparms.h encoded
    in the function SEAL_HE_STD_PARMS_128_TC, and can also be obtained from the
    function

        CoeffModulus::MaxBitCount(poly_modulus_degree).

    For example, if poly_modulus_degree is 4096, the coeff_modulus could consist
    of three 36-bit primes (108 bits).

    Microsoft SEAL comes with helper functions for selecting the coeff_modulus.
    For new users the easiest way is to simply use

        CoeffModulus::BFVDefault(poly_modulus_degree),

    which returns std::vector<Modulus> consisting of a generally good choice
    for the given poly_modulus_degree.

    The plaintext modulus can be any positive integer, even though here we take

    to be a prime number; we will see this in later examples. The plaintext
    modulus determines the size of the plaintext data type and the consumption
    of noise budget in multiplications. Thus, it is essential to try to keep the
    plaintext data type as small as possible for best performance. The noise
    budget in a freshly encrypted ciphertext is

        ~ log2(coeff_modulus/plain_modulus) (bits)

    and the noise budget consumption in a homomorphic multiplication is of the
    form log2(plain_modulus) + (other terms).

    When using Microsoft SEAL, it is typically advantageous to compute in a way
    that minimizes the longest chain of sequential multiplications. In other
    words, encrypted computations are best evaluated in a way that minimizes
    the multiplicative depth of the computation, because the total noise budget
    consumption is proportional to the multiplicative depth. For example, for
    our example computation it is advantageous to factorize the polynomial as

        4x^4 + 8x^3 + 8x^2 + 8x + 4 = 4(x + 1)^2 * (x^2 + 1)

    to obtain a simple depth 2 representation. Thus, we compute (x + 1)^2 and
    (x^2 + 1) separately, before multiplying them, and multiplying by 4.

    First, we compute x^2 and add a plaintext "1". We can clearly see from the

    budget consumption.

    Noise budget has reached 0, which means that decryption cannot be expected

    and x_plus_one_sq consist of 3 polynomials due to the previous squaring
    operations, and homomorphic operations on large ciphertexts consume much more
    noise budget than computations on small ciphertexts. Computing on smaller
    ciphertexts is also computationally significantly cheaper.

    `Relinearization' is an operation that reduces the size of a ciphertext after
    multiplication back to the initial size, 2. Thus, relinearizing one or both
    input ciphertexts before the next multiplication can have a huge positive
    impact on both noise growth and performance, even though relinearization has
    a significant computational cost itself. It is only possible to relinearize
    size 3 ciphertexts down to size 2, so often the user would want to relinearize
    after each multiplication to keep the ciphertext sizes at 2.

    Relinearization requires special `relinearization keys', which can be thought
    of as a kind of public key. Relinearization keys can easily be created with
    the KeyGenerator.

    Relinearization is used similarly in both the BFV and the CKKS schemes, but
    in this example we continue using BFV. We repeat our computation from before,
    but this time relinearize after every multiplication.

    Here we use the function KeyGenerator::relin_keys_local(). In production
    code it is much better to use KeyGenerator::relin_keys() instead. We will
